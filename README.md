The compression wizard is a program in C++ that utilizes the Huffman coding algorithm to achieve data compression. Huffman coding is a lossless compression technique that assigns variable-length codes to symbols based on their frequency of occurrence in the input data.

When compression wizard receives a data file as input, it begins by analyzing the frequency of each symbol in the file, creating a frequency table. This table is then used to construct a Huffman tree, where each symbol is represented as a leaf node with a weight determined by its frequency.

The Huffman tree is built by iteratively combining the two nodes with the lowest weights until all nodes are connected. This tree serves as the basis for generating Huffman codes, which are unique binary representations assigned to each symbol in the input file.

To compress the data, wizard replaces each symbol in the file with its corresponding Huffman code. This replacement results in a compressed representation that requires fewer bits to store compared to the original data. The compressed data, along with the necessary information like the frequency table or tree structure, is then written to an output file.

The key advantage of Huffman coding is that it assigns shorter codes to frequently occurring symbols, optimizing compression efficiency. Less frequent symbols are assigned longer codes, ensuring that no code is a prefix of another, maintaining the ability to decode the compressed data accurately.

In practical implementations, it would also handle file input/output operations, error handling, and provide a user interface for ease of use. By implementing the Huffman coding algorithm, your wizard achieves effective data compression by reducing file size while preserving data integrity.
